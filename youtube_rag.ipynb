              "[Document(metadata={'source': 'LsI20I6M92c'}, page_content=\"Hi everyone and welcome to a new video. In this video, I'm going to discuss my last one week of coding journey where I purely used VIP coding tools or coding assistants to code. >> Sign in. >> I don't hate this. >> I did not write most lines of code or probably a single line of code. I was able to ship three products and we're going to talk through this journey of is this the future of coding? What does this lead to in terms of the jobs that might exist in the future? Is coding as a job going to become obsolete? and my learnings in this one week of journey. Will I continue to use wipe coding tools or is there a specific framework I'd use to use these frameworks to you know my boost my productivity without any further ado let's get into it the video is going to divided into six parts the first part I'm going to share the apps that I built in the last one week there are total of three apps one was a very simple contest platform which was an assignment for the school students here I just wanted to see if the spec is written right is it able to create a UI/f follow the functionality that's expected it was a very basic MCQbased you know contest platform with an admin can come and create contests and users can come and give contests. I gave it some slightly challenging system design aspects. For example, um I asked it to code a real-time leaderboard in a more optimal way compared to, you know, the standard way you might think of creating a real-time leaderboard. When I say real-time leaderboard, I just mean people can during the contest see the ranks. I was able to do it fairly well. This is the most cruddy of the cruddest application that you can think of. And I think as a as an engineer, it would probably take you a day to write its back end and the front end can purely depend on you based on how much you want to finesse it. I was able to do it in probably two to three prompts which is fairly impressive and you know probably something I would use to code a project like this. The second project was poker. This was done live on stream. It's live on poker.ext.com. Has some mild bugs but overall a great productivity boost especially you know when it comes to writing a lot of rules of poker. It was able to do it out of the box without me having to explain anything which was super helpful. The last tool is a riverside clone which is a more you know technically challenging problem. video broadcasting tool come video recording tool come podcasting tool which is not very easy to build. It did require some level of you know human inter intervention from time to time. It doesn't work really well right now. If I show you what what it looks like um it's basically finessed the UI really well which is super impressive. This was done in two iterations. I tried to do it once failed miserably at the UI and then um me and someone else sort of did it together again purely using VIP coding tools and not touching the code ourselves and it works as you'd expect. You can come create a you know podcast to record with you and your friends. There's one very common bug here that the camera doesn't start which would be really hard to debug I'm sure. And then you can share this link with a friend start recording. It'll record the pod for you in HD and you can finally you know see the recording in a in a workspace of yours. Eventually ed editor can come and you know get the local recordings of all of these users and and edit this. This is exactly how Riverside works and is a product I've been paying around $300 a year for for a really long time. The problem here is there are a bunch of problems actually. Um, it doesn't work really well for longer pods. As you can see, there was an upload complete pop-up that showed up that shouldn't have. These are like very small inconveniences that I'm sure are easy to fix, but you need like a human to test it right now. That's the high level of, you know, the products that have been built over the last 3 to 4 days, like I'd say a week. And my learnings from it are going to follow from here. Long story short, if I was supposed to code these three products in a week, I wouldn't be able to do it. Poker specifically would take me a lot of time and finessing the UI as well as it was able to. example. Yeah, this isn't the worst poker table to look at. And games are generally harder to code, especially when you, you know, talk about canvases and, you know, rendering things on a canvas. Um, I don't know what happened here. They say Murphy laws exists for a reason. Um, and it just stopped working. I can swear it did not stop working for, you know, as many days as I've tried to use it. Um, but you get the idea. It's an invalid token. Probably logged me out or something. Um, but either way, uh, I it did not log me out, though. Um, you get the idea. There's one place where that becomes very infuriating to, you know, for a complete VIP coder to code an app like this is, okay, if you're stuck at some point like this, the debug process or VIP debugging is really hard. Um, but that's a high level of the apps that I made. Now, let's get into my learnings where I'm going to kick things off with um when it makes sense to completely vibe code your application and not touch, you know, code at all. And it might make sense for, you know, people who've never coded in the past um to, you know, maybe ship out a product. It works if you're building MVPs. It might work if you're building products that won't have a long life cycle. By which I mean most products that you look at, look at an Amazon website, their life cycle or the their commit history is years long and years old. And most products that have hit users are constantly be being updated right now by developers. And I think that will just remain true perpetually because as the codebase grows there are a lot of nuances, good things, bad things and context to maintain which context is something AI is really good at maintaining. But a lot of times or I would say most times in a bigger code base where there's constant upgradation that needs to happen and there's there are like there's real users you know touching your product and if something goes wrong it leads to revenue impact. it makes sense to have not one but many engineers. This is a true statement from all the friends that I have who have successful businesses or successful tech startups. Okay, they still they don't see AI changing anything and you know for some reason they still have to hire developers. Why is AI not you know completely replacing developers? This is not true for a lot of my friends who you know are just starting out a business for which you know it makes sense to take a very ideal approach of not hiring anyone and having a business where there's no you know technical person expense but unfortunately if your product does take off very high probability you will not have the time energy or context of the code. Basically you'll need someone to implement features. There's another approach or you know a devil's play here which is 99% of the products actually never reach users. Most of the code that is written in big tech or small startups a lot of times is never you know adopted by users or doesn't take off 99% of the startups fail which is why um there is definitely you know case to be made for less hiring because a lot of companies that don't really reach engineers um sorry don't really reach users might not really require engineers because initial MVPs the initial experimentation of you know trying to find product market fit might be doable without hiring someone and you know the CEO probably doesn't have funds um so it probably just makes sense for them to get a $200 subscription um then hire someone. The other case where I do think using a coding assistant makes sense is if you have well doumented instructions by which I mean the technical person knows what needs to be done as you know using the AI to move faster which makes total sense. Uh I don't think you necessarily have to not use AI um you know to be a better developer as long as you're explaining the problem well and you understand what's exactly being solved and just coding it right in front of you. It sort of makes sense to use these AI you know assistants. Moving on, the next step is or the next part is going to be on a senior engineer copium. Now, this this is where I'd uh like to introduce a very big problem that exists generally in coding um or the industry which is most engineers are doing uh a lot of mundane tasks that don't reach production or probably don't need to be done. This is specifically true for bigger companies. You know, think of a fang or an MNC or you know, a consult. What ends up happening is um there's a full chain of managers to engineers to you know junior engineers who are trying to showcase a lot of impact without the product actually you know having any impact um I've personally seen this at Goldman I don't think my product was you know super used if it was used it was built fairly well and a lot of times in 6 months to a year sprints whatever we were doing wasn't affecting the needle too much this showed up in our bonuses um I think the strat bonuses at Goldman were much more compared to you know the bonuses at in tech especially in my team because I don't think there was any real impact and here there's you know years of this already happening. So you know if you're an engineer who's you know late in their career a lot of them are facing issues coping or or you know accepting the fact that very specific skill that made them very necessary for the company to retain them is now an easy skill that doesn't necessarily mean the company would fire them but you sort of need to grow beyond the specific skill that you have and complacency hits really quickly in tech because you know if you specifically if you've been in a company in the same team for more than 3 four years either you're in a really good comp team which generally is not true like if you if you take probability into consider consideration if you're in a big company very high probability that the team that you're in there is you know somewhere or the other less impact and hence um once you get used to that lifestyle of low impact code and showcasing more than you've done it really hard to accept okay you know now even though this is a known truth for a long time now it's it'll become more and more apparent and now you know the the specific skill that you might think made you super relevant might not be as you know important of a skill and it might still take years I think big tech or you know generally big companies are highly unoptim able in their hiring and the kind of teams that are there. It might still take years for you know this reality to actually uh show up in the hiring and the firing in the team sizes. Um but it should eventually and it's not anything new probably just will be you know made a little faster thanks to AI but generally if you are a sing engineer uh might make sense to just not lie to yourself and figure out okay you know what you're actually good at and what is that specific skill that makes you hireable. Moving on um 99% not might not be good enough uh perfection is the bare minimum. Yeah, the the point here basically is if if you open any one of these, for example, if I open the Riverside clone that we had, um there's very small mild bug over here, which is if I am logged in, it still says, you know, start recording for free when it should probably say something like a dashboard. The margin of error over here becomes lesser and lesser because 99% of the work over here was done by AI. So, if you're showcasing this as a product or if you want to use this project to get hired, you have very little margin of error and the the website should just work. it. Unfortunately, if you have a very small nitpicky thing that doesn't work, it doesn't cut it anymore because there is not a human but a machine out there that's really smart at doing all of this. So, what you're really supposed to pull is the last 1%. This number was the last 5% up until a year ago. But right now, you know, as it gets better and better and a lot of things, for example, UI was something was really bad at and I don't really hate the UI that I see over here. In no form or fashion does it look vioded, the fonts that it chose, the colors that it chose look clean and not very standard. you know if you compare it to a VIP ported application when that becomes true what you really need to focus on is the last 1%. So make sure you don't skip that especially if you're building a product or if you're you know building a project to eventually get a job. Fifth point certain applications don't make sense now for example stack overflow tailwind saw you know a revenue dump of around 75%. Check is an was a very popular website back in the day and you know is not really needed anymore. This has nothing to do with AI affecting coding but unfortunately a lot of businesses will become obsolete. A lot of new businesses will come up probably most probably the value that will be created or the market cap of the companies that are going to come that use the power of AI for example available cursor cloud code is probably going to be more compared to the business that are going to die but you need to be very sure about you know what market your company was in or what market you might want to target for a product because a lot of these things that worked well up until 3 years ago might not be good products to pursue might not see the growth that they saw for many years and hence might not be good businesses to pursue, you know, in the long run. New applications make a lot of sense and it might just make sense for you to figure out what are these new use cases that AI unlocks and build products on top of them. A good example of this is 90 95% of the YC batch right now which arguably is you know one of the better VCs out there who's made some of the best bets and has gotten the best ROI for their investors now are AI companies at least 90% of the batch is now building AI for XYZ um which leads to a very common thesis that these guys have which is AI is going to unlock new use cases in many industries they want to bet on people who are finding or spending their time on those use cases because they feel that these this is a market that will grow exponentially compared to others ICO was one of the first companies to invest in Stripe which you know back then no one could think hey there'll be an API company that will end up replacing banks or you know helping banks. They were one of the first investors in um Coinbase which is you know today is probably one of the biggest if not the biggest exchange cryptocurrency exchange. They could just see through these trends and one of the trends that there's overly bullish on right now maybe a little too much is AI in XYZ. Hence, it makes sense for you to figure out if you're building a business, if you're applying for a job, which niche that specific product is in. And I would blindly pick, you know, something that uses AI right now. Lastly, if I have a deadline, I would wipe code. A lot of times, companies force you to wipe code to be productive, which is fine. >> You like crazy than a year. I think it makes sense for me to wipe code. When I say wipe code, I mean I not even look at the code because whenever I have to look at the code, I'll probably understand it. But if there's a language I'm not super comfortable in. Let's say I want to learn C today. I would definitely not wipe code. I would struggle through the process because you know the learning that you have in that one year and then you using V coding tools is probably you know a more productive path for your career compared to you using V coding you know from the get- go. It doesn't matter how good AI coding tools become. If your brain is not being developed in the process, it's probably going to hurt you in the long run. But you know this could just be me and I could be a fairly could be a fairly boomer sort of a an opinion. But I personally feel that will sort of remain true almost forever which is you need to hone your craft and irrespective of how good AI becomes. Do use it if you're really good at your craft. But if not if you're in your learning phase probably makes sense for you to use it as a tutor or probably not use it at all and work in the you know prelimm era which is where thankfully I was you know I learned to code which was you know 2014 2015 when you had to struggle through solving most of these processes and you know there wasn't even YouTube videos or great docs back then. Stack overflow was probably the best resource to you know get your doubts solved. to just turn your machine back to 2015. By which I mean stop all AI coding tools slash probably even LLMs. Unless you're using LM, right? Um you might have a better outcome in the longer run if your goal um is to become a software developer. With that, hopefully you learned something new today. I'll see you guys in the next one.

Um, it doesn't work really well for longer pods. As you can see, there was an upload complete pop-up that showed up that shouldn't have. These are like very small inconveniences that I'm sure are easy to fix, but you need like a human to test it right now. That's the high level of, you know, the products that have been built over the last 3 to 4 days, like I'd say a week. And my learnings from it are going to follow from here.

Now, let's get into my learnings where I'm going to kick things off with um when it makes sense to completely vibe code your application and not touch, you know, code at all. And it might make sense for, you know, people who've never coded in the past um to, you know, maybe ship out a product. It works if you're building MVPs. It might work if you're building products that won't have a long life cycle. By which I mean most products that you look at, look at an Amazon website, their life cycle or the their commit history is years long and years old.

And I think that will just remain true perpetually because as the codebase grows there are a lot of nuances, good things, bad things and context to maintain which context is something AI is really good at maintaining. But a lot of times or I would say most times in a bigger code base where there's constant upgradation that needs to happen and there's there are like there's real users you know touching your product and if something goes wrong it leads to revenue impact. it makes sense to have not one but many engineers. This is a true statement from all the friends that I have who have successful businesses or successful tech startups.

This is not true for a lot of my friends who you know are just starting out a business for which you know it makes sense to take a very ideal approach of not hiring anyone and having a business where there's no you know technical person expense but unfortunately if your product does take off very high probability you will not have the time energy or context of the code. Basically you'll need someone to implement features. There's another approach or you know a devil's play here which is 99% of the products actually never reach users. Most of the code that is written in big tech or small startups a lot of times is never you know adopted by users or doesn't take off 99% of the startups fail which is why um there is definitely you know case to be made for less hiring because a lot of companies that don't really reach engineers\"),\n",

The other case where I do think using a coding assistant makes sense is if you have well doumented instructions by which I mean the technical person knows what needs to be done as you know using the AI to move faster which makes total sense.

Now, this this is where I'd uh like to introduce a very big problem that exists generally in coding um or the industry which is most engineers are doing uh a lot of mundane tasks that don't reach production or probably don't need to be done. This is specifically true for bigger companies. You know, think of a fang or an MNC or you know, a consult.

I would struggle through the process because you know the learning that you have in that one year and then you using V coding tools is probably you know a more productive path for your career compared to you using V coding you know from the get- go.

It did require some level of you know human inter intervention from time to time. It doesn't work really well right now. If I show you what what it looks like um it's basically finessed the UI really well which is super impressive. This was done in two iterations. I tried to do it once failed miserably at the UI and then um me and someone else sort of did it together again purely using VIP coding tools and not touching the code ourselves and it works as you'd expect. You can come create a you know podcast to record with you and your friends. There's one very common bug here that the camera doesn't start which would be really hard to debug I'm sure.

Long story short, if I was supposed to code these three products in a week, I wouldn't be able to do it.

It's an invalid token. Probably logged me out or something. Um, but either way, uh, I it did not log me out, though. Um, you get the idea.

When I say real-time leaderboard, I just mean people can during the contest see the ranks. I was able to do it fairly well. This is the most cruddy of the cruddest application that you can think of.

This has nothing to do with AI affecting coding but unfortunately a lot of businesses will become obsolete. A lot of new businesses will come up probably most probably the value that will be created or the market cap of the companies that are going to come that use the power of AI for example available cursor cloud code is probably going to be more compared to the business that are going to die but you need to be very sure about you know what market your company was in or what market you might want to target for a product because a lot of these things that worked well up until 3 years ago might not be good products to pursue might not see the growth that they saw for many years and hence might not be good businesses to pursue, you know, in the long run.

            "  \"answer\": \"\\\"Vibe coding\\\" or \\\"VIP coding\\\" refers to a software development approach that heavily utilizes AI coding tools and assistants to accelerate the development process. The core idea is to have AI generate code, handle UI intricacies, and potentially build complex applications with minimal direct coding intervention from the human developer. Key characteristics include a strong reliance on AI, a focus on productivity and speed, and an intention to \\\"wipe code\\\" (avoid direct coding). This method is particularly useful for meeting deadlines or when building applications where UI finesse is critical but manual coding is to be minimized. However, it's cautioned against when learning new technologies or when the goal is to develop fundamental coding skills, as over-reliance can hinder deep understanding and problem-solving abilities. Examples include building tools like video broadcasters, podcasting platforms, and contest sites using AI assistance.\",\n",
